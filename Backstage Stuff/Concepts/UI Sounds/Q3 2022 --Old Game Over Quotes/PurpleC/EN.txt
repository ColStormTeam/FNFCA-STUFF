You... You couldn't sing a song with me? Mmm... I understand that even you will refuse... Hurtful...
Hey Girlfriend! If you can hear me, then know... Thank you for at least trying to spend time with me!
My plan didn't work...
Why? Why did you give up? It's so disappointing...
How dare you just lose in a song like that? It's so easy!
Hmm... Singing sounds even just like me... You know? It's pretty ridiculous to lose!
My parents weren't disappointed in me because I'm a very kind girl. It's even nice to remember this!
How, then, could your boyfriend sing well with red buddy? Hmm... OH! You're apparently sitting on your boombox for the most part...
Have you ever sung something yourself?
Mmm... This is terrible... just awful... Ugh...
Wow... Your tits are even bigger than mine... HOW!? Interesting...
Player! Can you stop looking at her boobs!? It's very outrageous... And though stop... Friday Night Funkin isn't for kids... Heh... Then okay...
Ah! What's wrong with you, Girlfriend!? AMBULANCE! AMBULANCE!!
Can you show me your abilities in addition to teleportation? It somehow surprised me!
Oh... I thought that you were a straight master of your business... Lol...
How, then, could Grees sustain all its power? If you can't even stand your strength in the easy song Huh?
Ow... You're dead!? You need to bring a pack of juice and a bag of waffles. I love sweets very much!
HOW!? WHY DO YOU LOOK SO HILARIOUS?
Well... It seems that I need to bring shower gel, for the sake of one thing with you...
DAMN... I didn't take my phone to snap you and put it on the Rule34... Kidding... I'm going to call an ambulance.
