Wow... I beat the Scooby Doo team... What a surprise...
Well, don't get upset like that... You just need to warm up, and you will sing even better.
What? Do I have to say something bad? Ugh! I don't even want to do it...
Did you want to give up your victory for me? As is customary... Thank you...
To be honest, I didn't expect you to lose in such an easy song... How is it?
Oh... Now you'll have to call an ambulance, because you're not feeling very well...
Ahh... Now I can safely enjoy sitting on this beautiful fountain...
Oops... It seems we've gone too far with singing... (Giggles)
Shaggy... You should have seen your face... It's so funny!
Do you know? I'm even sorry that you lost... I don't even feel sorry to give up my victory, but know, for the sake of friends like you, I don't feel sorry for anything!
It seems to me that your strength has not yet been charged after you wanted to take revenge on Boyfriend...
It seems after such a victory, I need to go to the store to celebrate my victory by eating a sandwich...
I am grateful for my struggle, because without it I would not have faced my strength... lol... I didn't even understand what I just said...
I didn't fail. I just found 1 way that won't work. Mine...
Heh. My friend Browny was able to play with ease most of the time when I was playing football with him... And here... Just a little concert, with which I easily defeated you here. What kind of luck?
Do you know? When I watched your show as a child, I really dreamed of meeting you, but my parents rejected my dream because they believe that you do not exist... And who did I meet today? You!
My parents won't believe about your existence... Oh my god..
Huh! Unlike my younger brother, you are not so infuriating...
I wonder what Velma thinks about her terrible spinoff? Hmm...
Hey! Player! Let's do it all over again!
