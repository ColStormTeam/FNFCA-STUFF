Hey Buddy... Are you okay?
Yeah... I should have given you... A SUPER-RED APPLE!
Maybe you should visit our hospital to check your X-ray? Hold on... We can already see your broken bones... ugh...
What? Am I distracted by this concert for nothing?
Dude. You need to first find the right time to practice singing from your Girlfriend!
What a shame... it's horrible...
Maybe if you start the show over, maybe you'll feel better? Mmm?
Didn't I give you a heart attack? You look pretty weird...
What's throbbing between your legs right now? It looks pretty shameful!
Hey Girlfriend! Do you happen to know how to get your boyfriend back in line? I don't like his look!
You know? Even though I'm not exactly a tomato, but why did you turn blue like seawater?
Ladies and Gentlemen! I congratulate you! You've lost!
Hey lawyer! Bring me vodka here! This kid looks bad!
You still say that you will become like a sausage! Our city used to be like stupid trash, but now it's really good. Still, good people did it.
Hmm... Have you talked to Peppino by any chance?
Hooray! I won!
Lol. What are you? Deliberately lost for the sake of my victory? Thank you very much!
Maybe you lost, which I am very glad that I defeated you! Thanks!
Did you spam your keyboard on purpose, or were you in AFK to lose?
Emm... Did that pink girl rape you by any chance? Stop... UGH. This is your first time here... But dude, get back in line!
