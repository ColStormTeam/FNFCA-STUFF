AAH! YOUR APPEARANCE SCARES ME VERY MUCH!
Um... and this is the best coach in your opinion? I didn't sign up for this!
Do you know? Even if I won, it doesn't mean that I won't be scared anymore.…
Oh God… You really seem to have become worse in such periods of time, compared to how you competed with a blue-haired kid.
It seems that I got the wrong number... or the wrong address was written out to me by Whity…
Ugh… I give up! I'll always be so scared all the time…
Hmm... maybe if you should retire, then maybe you will get better?
The fact that they say about me that I can die from spiders is a complete lie.
Maybe we should maybe reboot? And start our training over again? Unless, of course, you want to.
Hey... compared to my best friend - Grays, who for some reason has not been there for a long time, you are more or less friendly and sociable… I hope he's all right…
Do you know why I don't know how to fight, and I'm very afraid of a lot of things? Because I was an orphan as a child. More precisely, I'm not the only one... my late brother was with me...
I can't believe I beat the most professional boxer who could take down anyone... Wow…
I don't even know if you were close? Or not? I have no idea.
As many people have told me: "If you suffer for a long time, then something will work out," but... You probably didn't suffer for a long time…
Ugh… You're kind of weird… What's the matter with you, Matt?
I'm going to complain to my psychologist that his discharge didn't work.
Ohh... after such an excruciating workout, I need to drink water... and in the meantime, think about it before restarting the song.
Ehh... if Charlie was next to me, he would be proud of me…
If you hadn't started to raise your singing so sharply, then you wouldn't have become like this... Bruh…
Hmm ... Not even an hour of training has passed, and already there is at least some experience ... Amazing…
